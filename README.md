#Analysis
The Truth Table created was created by using the given schematic.

The testbenches were coded to test the logic gate designs from the truth table.

The testbenches output matched the Truth Table line by line. Each output matched my truth table.

The testbench for the four bit works. The ucf file uploaded nicely is waiting to be tested.
